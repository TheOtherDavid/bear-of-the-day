Chasing its own tail
Trying to catch a snowflake on its tongue
Squeezing into a space that is too small
Splashing in a bathtub-sized puddle
Wearing a necklace of pinecones
Making snow bears on the ground
Trying to walk on its hind legs like a human
Doing a happy dance for honey
Hiding behind a very thin tree
Trying to juggle three acorns
Getting its head stuck in a honey jar
Rolling down a hill like a log
Poking a jelly-like moss
Balancing a stick on its paw
Making a funny face in a mirror-still pond
Sneezing from dandelion pollen
Trying to catch a beam of sunlight
Wiggling its ears to a rhythm
Wearing a camouflage of large leaves
Pretending to be a rock
Jumping over its own shadow
Sliding across a kitchen floor
Testing the boing of a branch

Shaking a tree to make it rain leaves
Walking with sticky honey-paws
Tying its fur into tiny tufts
Pouncing on a pile of laundry
Catching the first ray of spring sun
Watching a summer thunderstorm from a cave
Catching autumn leaves mid-air
Walking through a blizzard with purpose

Savoring the taste of a wild strawberry
Feeling the texture of ancient bark
Watching the world go by from a high branch
Closing eyes to hear the wind in the pines
Counting the stars one by one
Waiting for the first flower to bloom
Resting paws on a cool stone
Pondering the depth of a canyon
Watching a snail win a race
Breathing in the scent of pine needles
Feeling the warmth of a sun-baked rock
Listening to the echo of its own call
