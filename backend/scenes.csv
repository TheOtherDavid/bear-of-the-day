sitting on a mountainside
driving a car
having a picnic with animal friends
solving mysteries with friends
hibernating
Ambling through a pumpkin patch
Balancing on a log
Basking in moonlight
Catching salmon
Cavorting in a berry patch
Chasing butterflies
Chewing on a branch
Climbing a mountain
Climbing a tree
Cooling off in a pond
Crunching on chicken nuggets
Crossing a shallow creek
Diving for clams
Digging for roots
Eavesdropping on a picnic
Exploring a cave
Exploring a deserted cabin
Feasting on a beached whale
Fishing in a river
Frolicking in a field
Gazing at the stars
Guarding a Teddy Bear
Hiding in underbrush
Howling at the moon
Huddling during a storm
Investigating a bird's nest
Investigating a hollow log
Jostling with playmates
Juggling small rocks
Knocking over a trash can
Lazing on a riverbank
Leaping over a log
Licking a frozen lake
Licking dew off leaves
Lounging in a hot spring
Looking curiously at a butterfly
Looming over a hilltop
Lumbering across a bridge
Moseying along a path
Munching on grass
Napping in a sunny spot
Napping in a tree hollow
Nudging a fellow bear
Observing hikers
Parading through a village
Pawing at a beehive
Pawing at a butterfly
Peeking out of a den
Poking around a trash bin
Pondering at a lakeshore
Pouncing on prey
Prowling a jungle
Relishing a honeycomb
Resting in a meadow
Roaming a forest
Rolling in mud
Running through a meadow
Sauntering through a forest
Scaling a cliff
Scavenging near a road
Scratching against a tree
Searching for food
Hugging a tree
Shaking off water
Scaling a cliff
Shaking off water
Shooting through underbrush
Sitting by a campfire
Skulking near a road
Sliding down a snowy hill
Snatching a fish
Sniffing around a campsite
Sniffing the air
Snuggling with cubs
Soaking in the rain
Splashing in a stream
Splattering in a puddle
Staring at a rainbow
Staring into the distance
Stashing away food
Stepping through snow
Stomping through underbrush
Strolling along a beach
Sunbathing on rocks
Surveying a cliffside
Surveying a landscape
Swimming in a lake
Swinging on a vine
Tiptoeing around a campsite
Traversing a ridge
Trekking through a valley
Tussling with a rival
Wading through a marsh
Watching a sunset
Wrestling with a sibling
Yawning lazily
Admiring a field of flowers
Balancing on a river rock
Bouncing on mossy ground
Blowing dandelion fluff
Bundling up in leaves
Burrowing into soft sand
Chasing fireflies at dusk
Clambering over a fallen tree
Clapping paws at a rainbow
Collecting shiny pebbles
Creeping through tall grass
Curling up on a warm boulder
Dipping paws into tide pools
Drinking from a waterfall stream
Dusting off snowflakes
Embracing a tree trunk
Examining an interesting mushroom
Feeling the breeze from a mountaintop
Following a butterfly's flight
Foraging under bushes
Gathering colorful autumn leaves
Gazing at a distant waterfall
Gently poking a snail
Gliding down a grassy hill
Grooming fur beside a stream
Grunting at a curious squirrel
Holding a flower in paws
Inspecting a line of ants
Investigating a shiny puddle
Jumping on soft moss
Kicking up leaves with delight
Lifting a rock to peek underneath
Listening to birds chirp
Lounging in a hammock of vines
Loving the feel of cool mud
Mimicking bird calls
Observing a busy beaver
Organizing a pile of pinecones
Padding softly through ferns
Painting with berries on bark
Peering into a hole in a tree
Perching on a small hilltop
Picking apples from a low branch
Piling up sticks and stones
Playing hide and seek with cubs
Poking at bubbles in a stream
Pretending to be invisible
Prancing through tall wildflowers
Resting in a ring of mushrooms
Roaring playfully at echoes
Rolling down a grassy hill
Rummaging in a hollow tree
Savoring a fresh breeze
Scamping through a meadow
Scooping up water with paws
Sculpting mud into shapes
Shaking snow from branches
Sheltering under an umbrella of leaves
Sliding into a cozy burrow
Smiling at a friendly bird
Sniffing a fragrant flower
Soaking up warmth on a flat rock
Splashing water joyfully
Sprawling in a sunbeam
Spying on otters at play
Squinting at the sparkle of snow
Stacking rocks into a mound
Stepping on crunchy leaves
Stretching after a long nap
Swatting playfully at drifting leaves
Swishing a paw through water
Tasting dew on fresh grass
Tipping a paw into a chilly stream
Touching frost with curiosity
Treading softly through a meadow
Tugging gently at ivy vines
Tumbling with playful energy
Twirling with a gust of wind
Uncovering a smooth stone
Vaulting over a babbling brook
Wading in warm shallows
Warming paws by sunlight
Watching clouds shift and change
Wiggling toes in soft dirt
Wiggling with excitement at a discovery
Wrapping vines around a paw
Wriggling into a cozy spot
Sniffing a hollow log with curiosity
Watching leaves drift downstream
Pondering reflections in a still pond
Scratching an itch against a rough tree
Roaming through a patch of wild mint
Nuzzling into a patch of wildflowers
Nosing through scattered acorns
Wading through a meadow filled with tall grasses
Swaying side to side to forest sounds
Blinking slowly at a glowing firefly
Splashing across a shallow stream
Peeking at fish swimming below the surface
Rolling onto back to enjoy a sunbeam
